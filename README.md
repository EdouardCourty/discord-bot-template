# Discord Bot Template

[![ESLint](https://github.com/EdouardCourty/discord-bot-template/actions/workflows/ESLint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EdouardCourty/discord-bot-template/actions/workflows/ESLint.yml)

This project can be used as a template for future Discord bots.<br />

I'm using PM2 as my deployment tool and ESLint as my linter.<br />
Both config files can be found in the root directory of the project (`ecosystem.config.cjs` & `.eslintrc.json`)

### Commands

- `stats` - Shows the bot's statistics (Uptime, ping, linked servers)

### Contributing

Please submit any PR you want to this project. Make sure ESLint is passing.
